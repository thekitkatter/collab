# collab

This is the original starting line of this readme

- Kitkatter
 The readme will be a living document.
 
 As new things are tested out, the readme will develop into an index of all commands and processes tested. It will grow into a comprehensive wiki of how to do git commands, and will be updated as necessary by either the codeower or collaborators.
